## Task challenges:
It's the first time to work with drupal so it was challenge for me to do this task
 with two different versions of drupal (7 & 8) and know the differences between them in short time 
 

 
## issues
- todolist block

  1- i don't understand from the description if the user's role manager display the first 5 tasks of all users or of his tasks only
    so I took a decision to display the first 5 tasks of all users due date is today.
    
  2- I put todolist block in content region in drupal 7 but for drupal 8 i tried to use hock_preprocess
     to set region code deidn't work , you can set the region from the administration 
     admin/structure/block .
  
 ## Notes   
   - todolist drupal version 7 on branch drupal7
   
   - todolist drupal version 8 on branch drupal8
