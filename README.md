## Note
- todolist block

  1- i don't understand from the description if the user's role manager display the first 5 tasks of all users or of his tasks only
    so I took a decision to display the first 5 tasks of all users due date is today.
    
  2- I put todolist block in content region in drupal 7 but for drupal 8 i tried to use hock_preprocess
     to set region but I couldn't .
  
    
- export and import excel 

    impoert excel-> user can see only his imported tasks but if the user is manager can see all tasts
    export excel -> user export only his tasks but if the user is manager export all tasks
